# ShinyR-Interactive-Dashboard
A shiny app that allows user to explore Canadian climate change data in real-time.

It has an interactive tab called 'Explore climate change data' that lets the user explore different climate change data and come to their own conclusions. It also has a structured tab called 'My Climate change analysis' which gives my analysis of the data and what I discovered about climate change from it.
